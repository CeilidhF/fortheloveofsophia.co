<div class="pagetitle"> gabriele paleotti // great delight and taste in imitation </div>

<p>
Now, to better expound each of the three parts that must concur in every Christian image, let us starts with delight. To some it may appear superfluous to reason formally about delight, for there is no one so stupid and senseless that he does not feel great pleasure from beautiful pictures; our goal however is not to prove this but, rather, to account for the greatness of this delight and make known how much greater it is than it is perhaps commonly assumed to be.
</p>

<p>
Hence, we say that every pleasure derived from a thing always presupposed prior knowledge of it because from a thing unknown we derive neither pleasure nor displeasure. Such cognition in human is of three sorts: the first is animal, channeled through the senses of taste, smell, touch, and so on; the second is rational, which, albeit arising out of the sense as well, passes through the channel of reason and discourse to a higher level and assesses universal things in abstraction from anything material; the third is supernatural, born from a divine light infused into us through faith, by means of which we believe and know things that exceed not only the capacity of the senses but even any human discourse and rational intelligence. It is also called spiritual cognition, bestowed upon pure and innocent souls by the singular grace of God. 
</p>

<p>
To each of these cognitions, then, certain emotions are both conjoined and consequent, speaking in broad terms, for example love, hatred, sadness, delight, and so on. And so, from the first cognition, which is obtained by means of the sense when the object is suited and proportionate to them, there is born a delight that is called animal or sensual (without any negative overtone); from the second a delight called rational; and from the third a delight called spiritual. Hence, the same thing, since we may be cognizant of it in each of these three ways, may bring us three different sorts of delight, corresponding to each of the cognitions. Let us take the example of someone observing the starry sky: he derives the first delight form observing its lovely color and the fact that, as well as the circular figure of the moon, it is shared by such a vast array of stars, like so many lights in the distance: some larger, others that twinkle, yet others that move, while other remain in place. This variety and beauty give rise to great sensual pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
The same individual then begins to reason discursively about the size of each star and the rotation of the heavens, the course of the planets, the constant order of each, and the effects deriving from them on plants, animals, and many other elemental things, whence the intellect is gladdened and filled with this enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this there follows the third cognition, inasmuch as, when a man considers the rare and admirable beauty of these heavens, he thinks to himself, illuminated by God, how much more excellent the one who made them must be and with what providence and wisdom he chose, by means of these created things, to offer making a ladder leading up to eternal things and cause men to desire the goods of heaven. Then the soul feels an enjoyment deep inside, exceeding the other two mentioned above to the degree that it arises from a much more lofty and perfect cause. On this account, David says: "My soul refused to be comforted: I remembered God, and was delighted."
</p>

<p>
And because Christian law does not forbid any of these delights, as long as it is produced in the proper way - since it does not destroy the things of nature but gives them perfection, utilizing them as steps and means to attain the lofty end of eternal beatitude - so a Christian may equally derive each of these three sorts of delight from the sacred images we are discussing: that of the senses, that of the reason, and that of the spirit.
</p>

<p>
As regards the senses: it is a thing manifest to all that, the sense of sight being nobler than the others, it receives from pictures marvelous pleasure and recreation, from the variety of colors, from the shadows, from the figures, from the ornaments, and from the diverse things that are represented, like mountains, rivers, gardens, cities, landscapes, and other things. 
</p>

<p>
As regards rational delight: everyone may find the qualities of this or that visually rendered thing particularly to his taste, but there is one quality that is a universal standard applying to everything design may represent, and this is imitation. The wise say that just as man, out of all the other animals, is born with a high capacity to imitate, he correspondingly feels great delight and taste in imitation, by a natural instinct. This comes about, perhaps, because the proper virtue of man, by which he learns things, and in learning them transforms himself into them in a certain sense, is simply a power to imitate them with perfect judgement. This being a natural function, it follows that it should be pleasurable.
</p>

<p>
This imitation, which is so prominently in evidence in pictures, usually brings all the more delight in that it seems to render even distant things immediately present to men and, like the omnipotent hand of God and his minister nature, it appears to bring into being in a moment men, animals, plants, rivers, palaces, churches, to produce all the works that are to be seen in this great machine of the world; or else to set before our eyes in a moment the things already created by God and distributed in various locations and dispersed to every corner of the earth, almost outstripping and overcoming nature, which had determined its own proper seat and set confines for each in this or that place; with depiction they change location and go from being distant to present, from being large to small, and often enough from being ugly to being beautiful, provoking infinite pleasure and marvel. Such is the delight that imitation brings, that things that by their nature normally cause repugnance and horror in the viewer, like seeing a monster or a cadaver or a mole, have the opposite effect when they are well imitated, and delight us miraculously, something noted only by Aristotle but also by Plutarch: "A painted lizard, or an ape, or the face of Thersites, delights us not on account of its beauty but its resemblance, for some things are foul by nature and cannot become beauteous, but imitation is praised whether it expresses the likeness of either a beautiful thing or ugly one."
</p>

<p>
And while there is no art that does not imitate nature, as philosophers state, we call imitative par excellence those that imitate not only with proportion but also with resemblance. These include poetry and painting, which conform very closely to one another, and the author of precepts on poetizing illustrates almost all of them with examples taken from painting. This is why Plato said that imitation is only properly applicable to the senses of vision and hearing (by vision he meant painting and by hearing he meant poetry), and the reason is that both focus mainly on imitating. Hence, pictures that best imitate true life, to the point of deceiving animals and even humans on occasion, as Pliny narrates of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, have always been the more worthy of commendation and more greatly delighted their views.
</p>

<p>
There remains the third delight, which springs from spiritual cognition, about which it is not in doubt that, just as it has the most desirable of objects and is caused by a virtue more outstanding and durable and farthest removed from alteration and travail, it brings greater and more perfect delight. David signifies this when he says, "The words of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honeycomb," showing that the spiritual delights surpass by far all the others deriving from material things. Therefore, just as the delight of the intellect exceeds that of the mere senses, spiritual delight is superior to all the rest.
</p>

<p>
From this we may conclude that, in addition to the first and second kinds of delight, which normally come to everyone withe ease, there follows this third one, which, by as much as it excels the others, tends more to be awakened in noble souls by means of pious images. One author (Petrarca) says: "Delight from painted panels, as long as we govern ourselves judiciously, should elevate us to celestial love and remind us of our origin; for did anyone ever seek the rivulet but that the spring?" So we are in no doubt that anyone who gazes upon Christian pictures with a purged eye will participate in all these delights.
