</br>
</br>
The critique of the faculties of cognition with regard to what they can
accomplish a priori has, strictly speaking, no domain with regard to
objects, because it is not a doctrine, but only has to investigate whether
and how a doctrine is possible through it given the way it is situated
with respect to our faculties. Its field extends to all the presumptions
of that doctrine, in order to set it within its rightful limits. However,
what cannot enter into the division of philosophy can nevertheless
enter as a major part into the critique of the pure faculty of cognition
in general if, namely, it contains principles that are for themselves fit
neither for theoretical nor for practical use.
</br>
</br>
The concepts of nature, which contain the ground for all theoretical
cognition a priori, rested on the legislation of the understanding. - The
concept of freedom, which contains the ground for all sensibly unconditioned
practical precepts a priori, rested on the legislation of reason.
Both faculties thus have, in addition to the fact that in accordance with
logical form they can be applied to principles whatever their origin
might be, their own legislation concerning content, beyond which
there is no other (a priori), which hence justifies the division of philosophy
into the theoretical and the practical.
</br>
</br>
But in the family of the higher faculties of cognition there is still an
intermediary between the understanding and reason. This is the power
of judgment, about which one has cause to presume, by analogy, that
it too should contain in itself a priori, if not exactly its own legislation,
then still a proper principle of its own for seeking laws, although a
merely subjective one; which, even though it can claim no field of
objects as its domain, can nevertheless have some territory and a certain
constitutiona of it, for which precisely this principle only might be
valid.
</br>
</br>
To this, however (to judge by analogy), a fresh ground is added for
bringing the power of judgment into association with another ordering
of our powers of representation, which seems to be of still greater
importance than that of its kinship with the family of faculties of
cognition. For all faculties or capacities of the soul can be reduced to
the three that cannot be further derived from a common ground: the
faculty of cognition, the feeling of pleasure and displeasure, and the faculty of desire. For the faculty of cognition only the understanding
is legislative, if (as must be the case if it is considered for
itself, without being mixed up with the faculty of desire), it is related
as a faculty of a theoretical cognition to nature, with regard to which
alone (as appearance) it is possible for us to give laws through a priori concepts of nature, which are, strictly speaking, pure concepts of the
understanding. - For the faculty of desire, as a higher faculty in accordance
with the concept of freedom, reason alone (in which alone this
concept has its place) is legislative a priori. - Now between the faculty
of cognition and that of desire there is the feeling of pleasure, just as
the power of judgment is contained between the understanding and
reason. It is therefore to be suspected at least provisionally that the
power of judgment likewise contains an a priori principle for itself, and,
since pleasure or displeasure is necessarily combined with the faculty
of desire (whether, as in the case of the lower faculty of desire, it
precedes the principle of that faculty or, as in the case of the upper, it
follows only from the determination of that faculty through the moral
law), it will likewise effect a transition from the pure faculty of cognition,
i.e., from the domain of the concepts of nature, to the domain of
the concept of freedom, just as in its logical use it makes possible the
transition from understanding to reason.
</br>
</br>
Thus even if philosophy can be divided into only two parts, the
theoretical and the practical; even if everything that we might have to
say about the proper principles of the power of judgment must be
counted as belonging to the theoretical part, i.e., to rational cognition
in accordance with concepts of nature; still, the critique of pure reason,
which must constitute all this before undertaking that system, for the
sake of its possibility, consists of three parts: the critique of the pure
understanding, of the pure power of judgment, and of pure reason,
which faculties are called pure because they are legislative a priori.
