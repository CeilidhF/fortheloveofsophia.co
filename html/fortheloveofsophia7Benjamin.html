The artistic performance of a stage actor is definitely presented
to the public by the actor in person; that of the screen
actor, however, is presented by a camera, with a twofold consequence.
The camera that presents the performance of the film
actor to the public need not respect the performance as an integral
whole. Guided by the cameraman, the camera continually
changes its position with respect to the performance. The sequence
of positional views which the editor composes from the
material supplied him constitutes the completed film. It comprises
certain factors of movement which are in reality those of
the camera, not to mention special camera angles, close-ups, etc.
Hence, the performance of the actor is subjected to a series of
optical tests.. This is the first consequence of the fact that the
actorts performance is presented by means of a camera. Also, the
film actor lacks the opportunity of the stage actor to adjust to
the audience during his performance, since he does not present
his performance to the audience in person. This permits the audience
to take the position of a critic, without experiencing any
personal contact with the actor. The audience's identification
with the actor is really an identification with the camera. Consequently
the audience takes the position of the camera: its approach is that of testing.10 This is not the approach to which cult
values may be exposed.
