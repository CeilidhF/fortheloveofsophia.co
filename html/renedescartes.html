<div class="humans">
I cannot share the opinion of Montaigne and others who attribute understanding or thought to animals. 
I am not worried that people say that men have an absolute empire over all the other animals; 
</div>
</br>

<div class="animals">
because I agree that some of them are stronger than us, and believe that there may also be some who have an instinctive cunning capable of deceiving the shrewdest human beings. 
But I observe that they only imitate or surpass us in those of our actions which are not guided by our thoughts. 
</div>
</br>

<div class="humans">
It often happens that we walk or eat without thinking at all about what we are doing; 
and similarly, without using our reason, we reject things which are harmful for us, and parry the blows aimed at us. 
Indeed, even if we expressly willed not to put our hands in front of our head when we fall, we could not prevent ourselves. 
I think also that if we had no thought we would eat, as the animals do, without having to learn to; 
and it is said that those who walk in their sleep sometimes swim across streams in which they would drown if they were awake. 
As for the movements of our passions, even though in us they are accompanied with thought because we have the faculty of thinking, 
it is none the less very clear that they do not depend on thought, because they often occur in spite of us. 
</div>
</br>

<div class="animals">
Consequently they can also occur in animals, even more violently than they do in human beings, 
without our being able to conclude from that that they have thoughts.
</div>
</br>

<div class="humans">
In fact, none of our external actions can show anyone who examines them that our body is not just a self-moving machine 
but contains a soul with thoughts, with the exception of words, or other signs that are relevant to particular topics without 
expressing any passion. I say words or other signs, because deaf-mutes use signs as we use spoken words; 
and I say that these signs must be relevant, 
</div>
</br>

<div class="animals">
to exclude the speech of parrots, 
</div>
</br>

<div class="humans">
without excluding the speech of madmen, which is relevant to particular topics even though it does not follow reason. 
I add also that these words or signs must not express any passion, to rule out not only cries of joy or sadness and the like, 
but also whatever can be taught by training to animals. 
</div>
</br>

<div class="animals">
If you teach a magpie to say good-day to its mistress, when it sees her approach, this can only be by making the utterance of 
this word the expression of one of its passions. For instance it will be an expression of the hope of eating, if it has always 
been given a tidbit when it says it. Similarly, all the things which dogs, horses, and monkeys are taught to perform are only 
expressions of their fear, their hope, or their joy; and consequently they can be performed without any thought. 
</div>
</br>

<div class="humans">
Now it seems to me very striking that the use of words, so defined, is something peculiar to human beings. 
Montaigne and Charron may have said that there is more difference between one human being and another than between a human 
being and an animal;
</div>
</br> 

<div class="animals">
but there has never been known an animal so perfect as to use a sign to make other animals understand something which expressed no passion; 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="humans">
and there is no human being so imperfect as not to do so, since even deaf-mutes invent special signs to express their thoughts. 
</div>
</br> 


<div class="animals">
This seems to me a very strong argument to prove that the reason why animals do not speak 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="humans">
as we do 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="animals">
is not that they lack the organs but that they have no thoughts. It cannot be said that they speak to each other and that 
we cannot understand them; because since dogs and some other animals express their passions to us, they would express their 
thoughts also if they had any.
I know that animals do many things better than we do, but this does not surprise me. 
It can even be used to prove they act naturally and mechanically, like a clock which tells the time better than our judgement does. 
Doubtless when the swallows come in spring, they operate like clocks. The actions of honeybees are of the same nature, and the discipline 
of cranes in flight, and of apes in fighting, if it is true that they keep discipline. Their instinct to bury their dead is no stranger than 
that of dogs and cats who scratch the earth for the purpose of burying their excrement; they hardly ever actually bury it, 
which shows that they act only by instinct and without thinking. The most that one can say is that though the animals do not 
perform any action which shows us that they think, still, since the organs of their body are not very different from ours, 
it may be conjectured that there is attached to those organs some thoughts such as we experience in ourselves, but of a very much 
less perfect kind. To which I have nothing to reply except that if they thought 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="humans">
as we do, they would have an immortal soul like us. 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="animals">
This is unlikely, because there is no reason to believe it of some animals without believing it of all, and many of them such as 
oysters and sponges are too imperfect for this to be credible. 
</div>
</br> 

<div class="humans">
But I am afraid of boring you with this discussion, and my only 
desire is to show you that I am, etc.
