Every science has at some time or other looked for causes of
action inside the things it has studied. Sometimes the practice
has proved useful, sometimes it has not. There is nothing
wrong with an inner explanation as such, but events which are
located inside a system are likely to be difficult to observe. For
this reason we are encouraged to assign properties to them
without justification. Worse still, we can invent causes of this
sort without fear of contradiction. The motion of a rolling
stone was once attributed to its vis viva. The chemical
properties of bodies were thought to be derived from the
principles or essences of which they were composed.
Combustion was explained by the phlogiston inside the
combustible object. Wounds healed and bodies grew well
because of a vis medicatrix. It has been especially tempting to
attribute the behavior of a living organism to the behavior of
an inner agent, as the following examples may suggest.
</p>

<p>
Neural causes. The layman uses the nervous system as a
ready explanation of behavior. The English language contains
hundreds of expressions which imply such a causal
relationship. At the end of a long trial we read that the jury
shows signs of brain fag, that the nerves of the accused are on
edge, that the wife of the accused is on the verge of a nervous
breakdown, and that his lawyer is generally thought to have
lacked the brains needed to stand up to the prosecution.
Obviously, no direct observations have been made of the nervous
systems of any of these people. Their "brains" and "nerves"
have been invented on the spur of the moment to lend
substance to what might otherwise seem a superficial account
of their behavior
</p>

<p>
The sciences of neurology and physiology have not divested
themselves entirely of a similar practice. Since techniques for
observing the electrical and chemical processes in nervous
tissue had not yet been developed, early information about the nervous system
was limited to its gross anatomy. Neural processes could
only be inferred from the behavior which was said to result
from them. Such inferences were legitimate enough as
scientific theories, but they could not justifiably be used to
explain the very behavior upon which they were based. The
hypotheses of the early physiologist may have been sounder
than those of the layman, but until independent evidence
could be obtained, they were no more satisfactory as
explanations of behavior. Direct information about many of
the chemical and electrical processes in the nervous system
is now available. Statements about the nervous system are
no longer necessarily inferential or fictional. But there is
still a measure of circularity in much physiological
explanation, even in the writings of specialists. In World
War I a familiar disorder was called "shell shock."
Disturbances in behavior were explained by arguing that
violent explosions had damaged the structure of the nervous
system, though no direct evidence of such damage was
available. In World War II the same disorder was classified
as "neuropsychiatric." The prefix seems to show a continuing
unwillingness to abandon explanations in terms of
hypothetical neural damage.
</p>

<p>
Eventually a science of the nervous system based upon
direct observation rather than inference will describe the
neural states and events which immediately precede
instances of behavior. We shall know the precise
neurological conditions which immediately precede, say, the
response, "No, thank you." These events in turn will be
found to be preceded by other neurological events, and these
in turn by others. This series will lead us back to events
outside the nervous system and, eventually, outside the
organism. In the chapters which follow we shall consider
external events of this sort in some detail. We shall then be
better able to evaluate the place of neurological explanations
of behavior. However, we may note here that we do not have
and may never have this sort of neurological information at
the moment it is needed in order to predict a specific
instance of behavior. It is even more unlikely that we shall
be able to alter the nervous system directly in order to set up
the antecedent conditions of a particular instance. The
causes to be sought in the nervous system are, therefore, of limited usefulness in the prediction and
control of specific behavior.
</p>

<p>
Psychic inner causes. An even more common practice is to
explain behavior in terms of an inner agent which lacks
physical dimensions and is called "mental" or "psychic." The
purest form of the psychic explanation is seen in the animism
of primitive peoples. From the immobility of the body after
death it is inferred that a spirit responsible for movement has
departed. The enthusiastic person is, as the etymology of the
word implies, energized by a "god within." It is only a
modest refinement to attribute every feature of the behavior of
the physical organism to a corresponding feature of the
"mind" or of some inner "personality." The inner man is
regarded as driving the body very much as the man at the
steering wheel drives a car. The inner man wills an action,
the outer executes it. The inner loses his appetite, the outer
stops eating. The inner man wants and the outer gets. The
inner has the impulse which the outer obeys.
</p>

<p>
It is not the layman alone who resorts to these practices, for
many reputable psychologists use a similar dualistic system of
explanation. The inner man is sometimes personified clearly, as
when delinquent behavior is attributed to a "disordered
personality," or he may be dealt with in fragments, as when
behavior is attributed to mental processes, faculties, and traits.
Since the inner man does not occupy space, he may be
multiplied at will. It has been argued that a single physical
organism is controlled by several psychic agents and that its
behavior is the resultant of their several wills. The Freudian
concepts of the ego, superego, and id are often used in this
way. They are frequently regarded as nonsubstantial creatures,
often in violent conflict, whose defeats or victories lead to the
adjusted or maladjusted behavior of the physical organism in
which they reside.
</p>

<p>
Direct observation of the mind comparable with the
observation of the nervous system has not proved feasible. It
is true that many people believe that they observe their
"mental states" just as the physiologist observes neural
events, but another interpretation of what they observe is
possible, as we shall see in Chapter XVII. Introspective
psychology no longer pretends to supply direct information about events which are the causal antecedents, rather than
the mere accompaniments, of behavior. It defines its
"subjective" events in ways which strip them of any
usefulness in a causal analysis. The events appealed to in
early mentalistic explanations of behavior have remained
beyond the reach of observation. Freud insisted upon this by
emphasizing the role of the unconscious - a frank
recognition that important mental processes are not directly
observable. The Freudian literature supplies many examples
of behavior from which unconscious wishes, impulses,
instincts, and emotions are inferred. Unconscious thought processes
have also been used to explain intellectual
achievements. Though the mathematician may feel that he
knows "how he thinks," he is often unable to give a coherent
account of the mental processes leading to the solution of a
specific problem. But any mental event which is
unconscious is necessarily inferential, and the explanation is
therefore not based upon independent observations of a valid
cause.
</p>

<p>
The fictional nature of this form of inner cause is shown
by the ease with which the mental process is discovered to
have just the properties needed to account for the behavior.
When a professor turns up in the wrong classroom or gives
the wrong lecture, it is because his mind is, at least for the
moment, absent. If he forgets to give a reading assignment,
it is because it has slipped his mind (a hint from the class
may remind him of it). He begins to tell an old joke but
pauses for a moment, and it is evident to everyone that he is
trying to make up his mind whether or not he has already
used the joke that term. His lectures grow more tedious with
the years, and questions from the class confuse him more
and more, because his mind is failing. What he says is often
disorganized because his ideas are confused. He is
occasionally unnecessarily emphatic because of the force of
his ideas. When he repeats himself, it is because he has an
idee fixe; and when he repeats what others have said, it is
because he borrows his ideas. Upon occasion there is
nothing in what he says because he lacks ideas. In all this it
is obvious that the mind and the ideas, together with their
special characteristics, are being invented on the spot to
provide spurious explanations. A science of behavior can
hope to gain very little from so cavalier a practice. Since
mental or psychic events are asserted to lack the dimensions of
physical science, we have an additional reason for rejecting
them.
</p>

<p>
Conceptual inner causes. The commonest inner causes
have no specific dimensions at all, either neurological or
psychic. When we say that a man eats because he is hungry,
smokes a great deal because he has the tobacco habit, fights
because of the instinct of pugnacity, behaves brilliantly because
of his intelligence, or plays the piano well because of his musical
ability, we seem to be referring to causes. But on analysis these
phrases prove to be merely redundant descriptions. A single set
of facts is described by the two statements: "He eats" and "He
is hungry." A single set of facts is described by the two
statements: "He smokes a great deal" and "He has the
smoking habit." A single set of facts is described by the two
statements: "He plays well" and "He has musical ability." The
practice of explaining one statement in terms of the other is
dangerous because it suggests that we have found the cause and
therefore need search no further. Moreover, such terms as
"hunger," "habit," and "intelligence" convert what are
essentially the properties of a process or relation into what
appear to be things. Thus we are unprepared for the properties
eventually to be discovered in the behavior itself and
continue to look for something which may not exist.
