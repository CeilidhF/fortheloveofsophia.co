The simplest introduction to the range of phenomena I want to explore
is the beautiful parable with which Herbert Simon opens chapter
three of The Sciences of the Artificial, a chapter to which he gives the
subtitle "Embedding Artifice in Nature."

<p>
Simon summarizes the lesson of his parable twice, word-for-word the
same, except for those indicating the subject of the behavior.
</p>

<p>
An ant [A man] viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The
apparent complexity of its [his] behavior over time is largely a reflection
of the complexity of the environment in which it [he] finds itself
[himself ].
</p>

<p>
This lesson can be taken in two rather different ways. On the one
hand, one might heave a sigh of scientific relief: understanding people
as behaving systems is going to be easier than we thought, because so
much of the apparent complexity in their behavior is due to factors
external to them, and hence external to our problem. On the other
hand, one might see the problem itself as transformed: since the relevant
complexity in the observed behavior depends on so much more
than the behaving system itself, the investigation cannot be restricted to that system alone, but must extend to some larger structure of
which it is only a fraction.
</p>

<p>
That Simon himself took the lesson in the first way is evident from
the two "hedges" that he immediately offers - both of which strike me
as quite remarkable (and ultimately untenable).
</p>

<p>
Now I should like to hedge my bets a little. Instead of trying to
consider the "whole man," fully equipped with glands and viscera,
I should like to limit the discussion to Homo sapiens,
"thinking man." I should also like to hedge my bets in a
second way, for a human being can store away in memory a great
furniture of information that can be evoked by appropriate
stimuli. Hence I would like to view this information-packed
memory less as part of the organism than as part of the environment
to which it adapts.
</p>

<p>
With these qualifications in place, Simon can safely turn his attention
away not only from sand dunes and pebbles, but also from human
knowledge, culture, the body, and the world, so as to concentrate on
cryptarithmetic and nonsense syllables-all in support of his view
that the human "information processing system" (essentially a glorified
cpu) must be serial and rather simple. In effect, he wants to pare
away enough of the real human being that what's left is strikingly like
an ant.
</p>

<p>
The alternative reading of the parable, however, is already suggested
by the history of artificial intelligence research itself. Perhaps
the largest-scale trend in this history has been precisely counter to the
suggestion of relegating knowledge ("information-packed memory")
to the "environment"-that is, regarding it as external to the problem
of understanding intelligence. The essential point of systems based on
semantic nets, frames, internal models, prototypes, and "common
sense" is that, except in very special circumstances, the intelligent
performance of a system depends more directly on the particular interconnectedness
and organization of its knowledge, than on any reasoning
or processing power. Note that the issue is not the quantity of
information, but its specific quality-its concrete structure. Everything
is in the details-that these items are grouped together, that there is a
cross-reference from here to there, that this topic appears in that index
with those keys-in such a way that abstracting the form of the knowledge
from its content would make no sense. In other words, according to this trend in ai, to study (or build) intelligent systems is, above all, to
study (or build) large, concrete knowledge structures-not simple
processors.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, however, nearly all of this research has retained the
assumption that the relevant "furniture of information" is implemented
as complex symbol structures that are, in many respects, just
like the contents of the traditional Cartesian mind. In particular, they
are internal to the individual agent, and different in kind from any
physiology or hardware. The explorations that follow can be seen as
trying out the second reading of Simon's parable in a more radical way.
If the significant complexity of intelligent behavior depends intimately
on the concrete details of the agent's embodiment and worldly situation,
then perhaps intelligence as such should be understood as characteristic,
in the first instance, of some more comprehensive structure
than an internal, disembodied "mind," whether artificial or natural.
