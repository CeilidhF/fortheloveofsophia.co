 When NASA sent the Pioneer 10 space probe to explore the solar
system in 1972, they placed on board a metal plate, engraved with
various pictures and signs. On one part of the plate was a diagram
of a hydrogen atom, while on another was a diagram of the relative
sizes of the planets in our solar system, indicating the planet from
which Pioneer 10 came. The largest picture on the plate was a line
drawing of a naked man and a naked woman, with the man's right
hand raised in greeting. The idea behind this was that when Pioneer
10 eventually left the solar system it would pursue an aimless
journey through space, perhaps to be discovered in millions of years
time by some alien life form. And perhaps these aliens would be
intelligent, and would be able to understand the diagrams, recognise
the extent of our scientifi c knowledge, and come to realise that our
intentions towards them, whoever they may be, are peaceful.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that there is something very humorous about this
story. Suppose that Pioneer 10 were to reach some distant star. And
suppose that the star had a planet with conditions that could sustain
life. And suppose that some of the life forms on this planet were
intelligent and had some sort of sense organs with which they could
perceive the plate in the spacecraft. This is all pretty unlikely. But
even having made these unlikely suppositions, doesn't it seem even
more unlikely that the aliens would be able to understand what the
symbols on the plate mean?
</p>

<p>
Think about some of the things they would have to understand.
They would have to understand that the symbols on the plate were
symbols - that they were intended to stand for things, and were not
just random scratches on the plate, or mere decoration. Once the
aliens knew that they were symbols, they would have to understand
what sort of symbols they were: for example, that the diagram of
the hydrogen atom was a scientifi c diagram and not a picture. Then 
The puzzle of representation they would have to have some idea of what sorts of things the
symbols symbolised: that the drawing of the man and woman symbolised
life forms rather than chemical elements, that the diagram of
the solar system symbolises our part of the universe rather than the
shape of the designers of the spacecraft. And - perhaps most absurd
of all - even if they did fi gure out what the drawings of the man and
woman were, they would have to recognise that the raised hand was
a sign of peaceful greeting rather than of aggression, impatience or
contempt, or simply that it was the normal position of this part of
the body.
</p>

<p>
When you consider all this, doesn't it seem even more unlikely
that the imagined aliens would understand the symbols than that
the spaceship would arrive at a planet with intelligent life in the
fi rst place?
</p>

<p>
One thing this story illustrates, I think, is something about the
philosophical problem or puzzle of representation. The drawings and
symbols on the plate represent things - atoms, human beings, the
solar system - but the story suggests that there is something puzzling
about how they do this. For when we imagine ourselves into
the position of the aliens, we realise that we can't tell what these
symbols represent just by looking at them. No amount of scrutiny of
the marks on the plate can reveal that these marks stand for a man,
and these marks stand for a woman, and these other marks stand
for a hydrogen atom. The marks on the plate can be understood in
many ways, but it seems that nothing in the marks themselves tells
us how to understand them. Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose philosophy
was dominated by questions about representation, expressed it succinctly:
'Each sign by itself seems dead; what gives it life?'
</p>

<p>
The philosophical puzzle about representation can be put simply:
how is it possible for one thing to represent something else? Put
like this, the question may seem a little obscure, and it may be hard
to see exactly what is puzzling about it. One reason for this is that
representation is such a familiar fact of our lives. Spoken and written
words, pictures, symbols, gestures, facial expressions can all be
seen as representations, and form the fabric of our everyday life. It is
only when we start refl ecting on things like the Pioneer 10 story that we begin to see how puzzling representation really is. Our words,
pictures, expressions and so on represent, stand for, signify or mean
things - but how?
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, representation comes naturally to us. When we
talk to each other, or look at a picture, what is represented is often
immediate, and not something we have to figure out. But, on the
other hand, words and pictures are just physical patterns: vibrations
in the air, marks on paper, stone, plastic, fi lm or (as in Pioneer 10)
metal plates. Take the example of words. It is a truism that there
is nothing about the physical patterns of words themselves which
makes them represent what they do. Children sometimes become
familiar with this fact when they repeat words to themselves over
and over until they seem to 'lose' their meaning. Anyone who has
learned a foreign language will recognise that, however natural it
seems in the case of our own language, words do not have their
meaning in and of themselves. Or as philosophers put it: they do not
have their meaning 'intrinsically'.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, then, representation seems natural, spontaneous
and unproblematic. But, on the other hand, representation
seems unnatural, contrived and mysterious. As with the concepts of
time, truth and existence (for example) the concept of representation
presents a puzzle characteristic of philosophy: what seems a
natural and obvious aspect of our lives becomes, on refl ection,
deeply mysterious.
</p>

<p>
This philosophical problem of representation is one main theme
of this book. It is one of the central problems of current philosophy
of mind. And many other philosophical issues cluster around this
problem: the place of the mind in nature, the relation between
thought and language, the nature of our understanding of one another,
the problem of consciousness and the possibility of thinking
machines. All these issues will be touched on here. The aim of this
chapter is to sharpen our understanding of the problem of representation
by showing how certain apparently obvious solutions to it
only lead to further problems.
