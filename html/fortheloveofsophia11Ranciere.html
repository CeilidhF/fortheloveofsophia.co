</br>
My title might lead readers to anticipate some new odyssey of
the image, taking us from the Aurorean glory of Lascaux's
paintings to the contemporary twilight of a reality devoured by
media images and an art doomed to monitors and synthetic
images. But my intention is different. By examining how a
certain idea of fate and a certain idea of the image are tied up in
the apocalyptic discourses of today's cultural climate, I wouJd
like to pose the following question: are we in fact referring to a
simple, univocal reality? Does not the term 'image' contain
several functions whose problematic alignment precisely constitutes
the labour of art? On this basis it will perhaps be
possible to reflect on what artistic images are, and contemporary
changes in their status, more soundly.
</br>
</br>
Let us start at the beginning. What is being spoken about,
and what precisely are we being told, when it is said that
there is no longer any reality, but only images? Or, conversely,
that there are no more images but only a reality
incessantly representing itself to itself? These two discourses
seem to be opposed. Yet we know that they are (orever being
converted into one another in the name of a rudimentary
argument: is there is now nothing but images, there is nothing
other than the image. And if there is nothing other than the
image, the very notion of the image becomes devoid of
content. Several contemporary authors thus contrast the image, which refers to an Other, and the Visual, which refers
to nothing but itself.
</br>
</br>
This simple line of argument already prompts a question.
That the Same is the opposite of the Other is readily intelligible.
Understanding what this Other is is less straightforward.
In the first place, by what signs is its presence or absence to be
reeognized? What allows us to say that the Other is there in one
visible form on a screen but not in another? That it is present,
for example, in a shot from Au hasard Balthazar and not in an
episode of Questions pour un champion? The response most
frequently given by detractors of the 'visual' is this: the
television image has no Other by virtue of its very nature.
In effect, it has its light in itself, while the cinematic image
derives it from an externai source. This is summarized by Regis
Debray in a book called Vie et mort de l'image: 'The image here
has its light in-built. It reveals itself. With its source in itself, it
becomes in our eyes its own cause. Spinozist definition of God
or substance.
</br>
</br>
The tautology posited here as the essence of the Visual is
manifestly nothing but the tautology of the discourse itself.
The latter simply tells us that the Same is same and the Other
other. Through the rhetorical play of telescoped, independent
propositions, it passes itself off as more than a tautology by
identifying the general properties of universals with the characteristics
of a technical device. But the technical properties of
the cathode tube are one thing and the aesthetic properties of
the images we see on the screen are another. The screen
precisely lends itself to accommodating the results both of
Questions pour un champion and of Bresson's camera. It is
therefore clear that it is these results which are inherently
different. The nature of the amusement television offers us,
and of the affects it produces in us, is independent of the fact that the light derives from the apparatus. And the intrinsic
nature of Bresson's images remains unchanged, whether we see
the reels projected in a cinema, or through a cassette or disc on
our television screen, or a video projection. The Same is not on
one side, while the Other is on the other. The set with in-built
light and the camera of Questions pour un champion place us
before a feat of memory and presence of mind that is in itself
foreign to them. On the other hand, the film of the film theatre
or the cassette of Au hasard Balthazar viewed on our screen
show us images that refer to nothing else, which are themselves
the performance.
