</br>
</br>
We're intrigued by consciousness, for example. We know there are close correlations
between brain events and conscious states - but why is that so? The answer seems to be
that our brains generate our consciousness. But how do they do this, in practice? Even
more puzzling, how can they do this, in principle?
</br>
</br>
Or maybe we only think we know this? Some people argue that it doesn't even make
sense to suggest that there are correlations between conscious states and brain states.
How could anyone with any common sense be led to make such a deeply counterintuitive
claim? Perhaps "common sense" itself is radically misguided here (and was
radically different in other historical periods)?
</br>
</br>
What about dogs and horses: are they conscious? And snails, flies, newts...? For
that matter, what about newborn babies: are they conscious in anything like the sense
in which adult humans are? What of machines? Could a machine be conscious - and if
not, why not?
</br>
</br>
People often wonder whether a creature has to have a brain, or something very like
one, to be intelligent. If so, why? Is a brain (as well as eyes) needed to see, for example?
What do the visual brain cells do that the retinal cells don't? What about intelligent
action? How, for instance, does the brain convert an Olympic diver's intention to dive
into the finely modulated bodily movements that ensue? If we knew this, could we drop
talk of intentions and refer only to brains instead?
</br>
</br>
Consider chimps, or cats: what can their brains do, and what can't they do? And
what can they do without the mammalian (and avian) glory, the cerebral hemispheres?
Given that Homo sapiens evolved from lower animals, what does this tell us about our
mental powers? Can anything interesting be learnt about the human mind by studying
distantly related species such as frogs, or insects?
</br>
</br>
As for machines, just how - if at all - must an artifice resemble a real brain if it's
even to seem to support a mind? And even if studying insects can teach us something
about ourselves, what about studying inanimate tin cans - like a Mars robot, or an
automatic controller in a chemical factory? How could these things (sic) possibly be
relevant?
</br>
</br>
What mental powers does a human brain provide, and how does it manage to do
so? How is free will possible? And creativity? Are creative ideas unpredictable, and if so
why? What are emotions - and do they conflict with rationality, or support it?
</br>
</br>
Are our abilities inborn, or determined by experience? And how does the brain get
its detailed anatomical structure: from genetics or from the environment - or perhaps
even from spontaneous self-organization? (Is that last suggestion mere hand-waving,
more magic than science?)
</br>
</br>
Do we all share psychological properties that mould every human culture? Perhaps
the same underlying sense of beauty: maybe in symmetry, or expanses of water? Or the same tendency towards religious belief? If so, is that because we've evolved that
way? Or are evolutionary explanations of human psychology mere Just So stories, no
more plausible than the delightful tale about The Cat Who Walked By Himself (Kipling
1902)? Superficially, at least, cultures are hugely diverse... but can they harbour just
any conceivable idea?
</br>
</br>
In mental illnesses of various kinds, what's gone wrong: something in the brain, or
something in the mind? What's the difference?
</br>
</br>
Sometimes, people say that only living things can have a mind. Is that true? If so,
why? What is life, anyway? And how did it arise in the first place? Could a living thing
be created by us?
</br>
</br>
Last, but by no means least, coffee-table chat abounds with puzzles about language.
For instance, people wonder what counts as a language: why not birdsong? Can any
non-human animals learn a language? If not, is that merely because we're better at
learning, or because language is a human instinct? And what, exactly, does that mean?
Is language needed for thought, or can some dumb animals think?
</br>
</br>
Can two different languages ever express exactly the same thought? Or is perfect
translation impossible? Could a machine converse with us in English, or French - and
would it understand us, even if it did? Imagine a machine that appeared to be
solving problems and using language just like us: would that prove that it was truly
intelligent?
</br>
</br>
None of these questions is new. (That's largely why listing them is a scene-setting
equivalent of saying "Once upon a time, there was a teddy bear...".)
</br>
</br>
Some date back to Aristotle. Many, including those about language-using machines,
were discussed in the 1630s by Rene Descartes. Others were considered by
Immanuel Kant, Johann von Goethe, or Wilhelm von Humboldt in the late eighteenth
century. The rest surfaced in the nineteenth, or very early twentieth, century.
</br>
</br>
Originally, then, most were discussed by philosophers. Some still are (the difference
between mind and brain, for example). But even those need to be considered in light of
the scientific data available.
</br>
</br>
Most of our Twink-questions were later developed - and some answered - by
traditional scientific research in psychology, anthropology, neurophysiology, or biology.
Since the 1940s, however, every one has been further sharpened by work in cognitive
science.
